**Project Topic:**

My project's name is "Eki Path".

"Eki Path" is a free ride-sharing application whose main focus is to connect people with other people, who use a private form of transport, to travel in the same route or destination as them.

**Project Goal and Objectives:**

The main goal of this project is to develop a cost-effective platform suitable for people (mainly women and students) in Bangladesh to connect with other students/people with private vehicles going to the same destination. The application will also aim to effectively reduce the traffic jam in Dhaka city by moving people efficiently from one place to another place.

The objective of this free ride-sharing application project is to design and build a mobile application to help students who use public transportation(for example- local bus, cng) to travel find other students/ people, who uses private transportation(for example- private car, bike, microbus etc) to travel in the same route as them.

The goals and objectives of my project are listed below,

- To create a database to store information about students/people who uses private transportation medium to travel.
- To store information of their starting journey location and ending destination. Also, their journey starting time and arrival time(ending time).
- To store information of the days of the week they travel in certain locations.
- To book rides online.
- To cancel rides if necessary.

**History Leading the project:**

The public transit system in the world's most congested city is exceedingly substandard and inappropriate for the majority of people. Students frequently have to put their lives on the line in order to compete with other passengers for seats on running buses. Men frequently take seats intended for women and physically challenged people, and bus conductors have a habit of not picking women during peak hours. Thefts and snatchings have been observed among users of public transit systems. Many women are forced to endure sexual harassment by personnel or fellow passengers while traveling by public transportation. The existing public transportation infrastructure is a key stumbling block to the city's development.

In a city with a population of more than 15 million people, the middle and lower classes are overwhelmingly represented. There is no well-organized, rapid, dependable, low-cost bus transportation system to serve these populations, and alternate modes of transportation are in high demand.

This is where "Eki Path" seeks to make a difference by linking people with others who are traveling the same route as them in private automobiles. Users with private vehicles will offer to give rides to those on the same route/destination as them through this free-ride sharing application.

**Project Analysis:**

| **Problem** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- |
| Currently, the public transportation system available in the country mainly consists of buses, cngs' and taxi, rickshaws. These are slow and time-consuming. They also contribute to the city's traffic problem. | The app solves this problem by letting users know the estimated arrival and departure time of the available rides beforehand. As a result, by offering a superior alternative transportation medium, it in turn helps to reduce traffic problems. |
| Public Transportations are unreliable and many times charge people extra fare depending on the circumstances. | The app relies on people offering other people free lift-service. Hence, it's a cost-effective solution. Furthermore, users can visit driver's profile to check their travel routes, days and times. Hence, the app is more reliable. |
| It is a hard task for the police to trace criminals who commit crimes like thefts or harassment in public transportation services like buses. | All data of users and drivers are kept in a database. Hence, it police can trace people quickly and easily if they commit any form of misconduct |

This free-ride sharing system can open wide range of opportunities in the future as we would be able to analysis the data and work on new features as well as make necessary changes if needed. Some of the opportunities are listed below:

- We can also enable people to deliver packages from one place to another without going through the hassle of traveling with the package in heavy traffic of the city.
- People can meet, connect, interact and make networks with new people from this friendly community created by this app.
- The government and other organizations can build or improve city's existing roads and transportation system problems by analyzing data from this application.
- Companies can market their products and services by partnering with the app developers.
- Commuters can give feedback which can help improve the system

**Product Summary:**

The project is about a free-ride sharing application which is focused on giving better transportation services by connecting people with other drivers travelling to the same destination/route as them. The app relies on drivers/ people with private cars to volunteer to free lift services to ca going to the same route/destination as them. The app will offer various discount coupons, vouchers and gift cards to the drivers from the revenue generated from the in-app advertisements.

**System Stakeholders:**

- Passengers (people without any private vehicle)
- Drivers(people with a private vehicle)
- System Engineers
- Mobile Application Administrators

### 1. Information Gathering:

#### A vital component of creating software that achieves its objectives is data

#### collection. Without considering their suggestions and opinions, we won't be able

#### to satisfy the demands of the software's users. I've chosen three key information

#### gathering techniques for my system: stories , interviews , and questionnaires.

### 1.1. Stories

### Story 1

### I made the decision to talk to a student named Nafisa Ahmed about her

### means of getting to university. Nafisa claims that Dhaka, the city with

### the highest traffic in the world, has a very poor public transportation

### system that is unacceptable for most people, especially women. Buses

#### are the most affordable mode of transportation, yet most of the time, bus

#### conductors refuse to let women into the bus due to men occupying reserved

#### seats for women. At other times, the bus is packed, and passengers must fight for

#### space on moving buses. Nafisa frequently has trouble finding CNG and cannot

#### afford to use Ubers every day. She must take multiple rickshaw rides as a result of

#### all of them in order to go home from university. Nafisa stated that, like many

#### other women, she had to deal with sexual harassment from staff members or

#### other passengers when using public transit. She wishes women had access to a

#### better transit system.


.

### Findings from the story.

- There is demand for a better alternative transportation system in

### Dhaka

- Passengers want a fast, reliable, cost-effective way to travel from

### point A to point B.

- Female passengers want a safe and comfortable form of

### transportation makes travelling convenient, accessible and easy.

### Story 2

### I had a conversation with a neighbor. Latif is a single man who resides

### in Dhaka. He had several challenges last Eid while attempting to reach

### his village. He was unable to purchase bus or train tickets. In order to

### get to his village, he had to take a life-threatening risk and ride on the

### bus’s roof. He wishes there was an automated internet system that

### facilitated interstate travel.


### Findings from the story:

- There is a need for an affordable and convenient alternative to

### interstate transportation.

## 1.2. Interviewing

### To better comprehend the situation, I decided to meet with the

### stakeholders. A crucial stage in gathering data and information to

### satisfy the criteria is conducting interviews. Interviews provide

### information on a wide range of crucial subjects. Goal justifications,

### important Human Computer Interactions, feelings and views, to name a

### few (HCI). I explained the operation of my smartphone app "Eki Path"

### to them at the start of our conversation. During the interview, both

### closed-ended and open-ended questions were posed. Open-ended

### questions allowed me to learn about their opinions and perspectives on

### the difficulty they had when searching for public transit, whereas

### closed questions helped me quickly conclude the session by obtaining

### the necessary and precise information (bus, cngs etc.). The Pyramid

### approach was utilized to organize the questions.
